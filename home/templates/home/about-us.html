                most of the food gets wasted during transportation.
                Moreover, Since as far back as one can remember, information and commodity flow in rural India have been
                dominated
                by players who have thrived on the opaqueness, inconsistency and fragmentation of the ecosystem.
                Technology, while making rapid strides in the everyday life of an urban dweller, has had little to no
                impact on the rural economy.<br><br>

                wastage, earn more by selling their
                produce directly to businesses and have comfort of selling from their home.<br><br>
                Weâ€™re building a future where farmers are businessmen, and not just growers. We want you to be a part of
